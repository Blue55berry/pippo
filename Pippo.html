 <p>Brownie cake is a delicious dessert that combines the rich, fudgy texture of brownies with the celebratory feel of a cake. It's usually made by baking a thick layer of brownie batter in a round or square cake pan, then optionally frosting or decorating it like a cake.</p>

<p>The Black Forest cake, also called Schwarzw√§lder Kirschtorte, is an authentic German cake made up of a chocolate layer cake with cherries in the middle and whipped cream on top. They are traditionally made with fresh Morello cherries, poached in a sugar syrup and pitted. It is a variation of the chocolate cake, and sometimes decorated with chocolate curls.</p>
